# SpotFake-A-Multimodal-Framework-for-Fake-News-Detection
DA241M : Minor Course Project

This repository contains the code for the paper titled: SpotFake: A multimodal framework for fake news detection published in IEEE BigMM 2019 (Best Poster Award).

The propose architecture aims to detect whether a given news article is real or fake. It does not take into account any other sub-task in the detection process.

The prime novelty of SpotFake is to incorporate the power of language models, i.e. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to incorporate contextual information.

The image features are learned from VGG-19 pre-trained on ImageNet dataset.

Dataset:

Twitter MediaEval 2016 (media eval 2016)
Weibo (WeiboRumorSet) All the necessary libraries used in implementation is listed in 'environment.yml' file.
